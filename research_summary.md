# State-of-the-Art Multimodal Emotion Detection Research Summary

## Research Findings

After thorough research, we've identified two promising approaches for multimodal emotion detection combining voice and text modalities:

### 1. MIST Framework

The MIST (Motion, Image, Speech, and Text) framework is a comprehensive multimodal approach to emotion recognition that integrates diverse data modalities. For our focus on voice and text:

- **Text Component**: Uses DeBERTa (Decoding-enhanced BERT with disentangled attention) for text emotion recognition
- **Speech Component**: Uses Semi-CNN for speech emotion recognition
- **Datasets**: Evaluated on BAUM-1 and SAVEE datasets
- **Advantages**: State-of-the-art performance, comprehensive framework, well-documented architecture
- **Paper**: "MIST: Multimodal emotion recognition using DeBERTa for text, Semi-CNN for speech, ResNet-50 for facial, and 3D-CNN for motion analysis"

### 2. Maelfabien's Multimodal Emotion Recognition

A complete implementation available on GitHub with detailed code and documentation:

- **Text Component**: CNN-LSTM architecture with Word2Vec embeddings
  - 3 blocks of 1D convolution, max pooling, spatial dropout, and batch normalization
  - 3 stacked LSTM cells with 180 outputs each
  - Final fully connected layer with 128 nodes
  
- **Audio Component**: Time Distributed CNN-LSTM
  - Log-mel-spectrogram extraction
  - Rolling window approach
  - Four Local Feature Learning Blocks (LFLBs)
  - 2 LSTM cells for long-term contextual dependencies
  
- **Datasets**: 
  - Text: Stream-of-consciousness dataset
  - Audio: RAVDESS (Ryerson Audio-Visual Database of Emotional Speech and Song)
  
- **Advantages**: Complete implementation available, well-documented code, preprocessing pipelines included

## Model Selection Recommendation

Based on our research, I recommend implementing the **Maelfabien's Multimodal Emotion Recognition** approach for the following reasons:

1. **Complete Implementation**: The repository provides full code implementation for both text and audio modalities
2. **Well-Documented**: Detailed notebooks for preprocessing and training
3. **Reproducibility**: Clear pipeline from data acquisition to model training
4. **Dataset Availability**: Uses publicly available datasets (RAVDESS for audio)
5. **Architecture Suitability**: CNN-LSTM architecture is well-suited for both text and audio emotion recognition

While the MIST framework represents the latest research, the Maelfabien implementation provides a more practical starting point for replication, with the ability to incorporate elements from MIST (like DeBERTa for text) as potential improvements in later stages.

## Implementation Plan

1. Set up development environment with required dependencies
2. Obtain and preprocess the RAVDESS dataset for audio and Stream-of-consciousness dataset for text
3. Implement the CNN-LSTM models for both audio and text following Maelfabien's architecture
4. Train the models on the respective datasets
5. Evaluate performance and compare with the original implementation
6. Optimize and document the implementation

## Potential Enhancements

After successful replication, we could explore:
- Replacing the text CNN-LSTM with DeBERTa (from MIST framework)
- Experimenting with Semi-CNN for audio (from MIST framework)
- Creating a unified model that combines both modalities for final prediction
